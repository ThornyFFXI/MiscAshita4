XIVUI is an outdated UI mod designed to show your party list and their buffs.
It is currently hardcoded to use the profile at 'resources\xivui\party\ffxi10buffs'.
This profile can be interchanged with the others or edited to change appearance of various elements.
This profile uses the 'Grammara' font by default.  You should install it then relaunch ashita if elements using that font don't appear.
There are no commands, just load it and it shows up.
