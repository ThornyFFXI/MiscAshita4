Stun is a basic/outdated tool similar to react.  You must create an XML file in:
Ashita/Config/Stun/File.xml
then use the commands:
/stun load File - Load XML
/stun on - Start process.
/stun off - Stop process.
/stun status [on/off] - Toggle whether commands should still execute while a status prevents them (turning while asleep, etc.)  Defaults to off.
/facetarget - Face toward your current target.  No safety checks.

XML format is documented in accompanying 'XML Structure' file.
