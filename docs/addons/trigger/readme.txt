Trigger is a basic addon that recreates functionality from an ashita3 plugin to bind certain controller buttons.
It is likely to be replaced by a more comprehensive option now that controller support is in ashita core.

Commands:
/trigger ls /command - Bind a command to left shoulder.
/trigger lt /command - Bind a command to left trigger.
/trigger rs /command - Bind a command to right shoulder.
/trigger rt /command - Bind a command to right trigger.
